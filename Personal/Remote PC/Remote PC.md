### Booting
#Boot For turning pc on using wake on lan works but requires #Network 


### Option 1
*KVM* and *HDMI* extenders
	1. Not sure if will work in tandem
	2. Easiest solution
	3. No DisplayPort option (Maybe PC -> DP -> HDMI -> DP -> SCREEN)
	4. Can try look for display port to ethernet instead

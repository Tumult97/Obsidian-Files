### Main Quests and side-quests
- Main quests are the base changes in a workflow
- Side Quests are side objectives that can be done adjacent to a main quest objective while that one is going. 
	- That main quest cannot continue without the side objectives being done. 
- Always have _States and Statuses_ #Main_Quest to define where an object is at and _Status Info_ #Side_Quest to define what can be done during a state/status

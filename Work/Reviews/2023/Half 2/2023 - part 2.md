  During a large in person meeting to started to work on other stuff and lost context. This showed you didn't respect the team's time and effort during that moment in the meeting and should've left the meeting to do the work.

  You made a very sarcastic comment while trying to discuss a MR aspect. This showed you didn't have respect for me and viewed me as lesser

  During the evening where we worked late on the limit switches you were the one assigned to the merge request and were making and resolving comments and at one point you just left with no message stating as such and there after I waiting for you for an hour. You blatantly disregarded myself and didn't value my time then. Please when people are waiting on you let them know if and when you are stepping out for the day so they aren't waiting on you.

  During this large meeting you berated me and reprimanded me for the same that others were doing and they got no comment against them. You actively looked down on me and made me feel as if any opinion I made had no value or merit to it

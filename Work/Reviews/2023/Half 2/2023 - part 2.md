  During a large in person meeting to started to work on other stuff and lost context. This showed you didn't respect the team's time and effort during that moment in the meeting and should've left the meeting to do the work.

  You made a very sarcastic comment while trying to discuss a MR aspect. This showed you didn't have respect for me and viewed me as lesser

  During this large meeting you berated me and reprimanded me for the same that others were doing and they got no comment against them. You actively looked down on me and made me feel as if any opinion I made had no value or merit to it

## Incidents
- With the ESNR covenants I asked for some help it felt like you belittled me when I asked for help adding in Jenkins variables even after timothy seconded my concerns and just brushed off adding the variables to a todo later thing. 
- You didn't make me aware that a complete refactor of work I relied on was being done so it made it impossible for me to merge in the new work on that section
- Didn't Let anyone know you were taking leave the next day and no out of office notification either
- When I asked for variables to be added to the build for EnS you said you would add it later and didn't when we needed to deploy to SIT. This was frustrating and made it look as if I didn't complete my work yet it was out of my control
- You Clearly didn't test a certain change because a change the change you made causes a circular dependency error that prevent the service from working
- You assigned me work and didn't talk to me before standup so I was caught off guard and business was then told that I had begun work on the ticket when I didn't even know i had it,

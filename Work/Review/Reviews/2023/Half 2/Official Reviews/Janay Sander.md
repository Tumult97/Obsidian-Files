### Occurrences

- ` 2023/06/06 ` 
  During a large in person meeting to started to work on other stuff and lost context. This showed you didn't respect the team's time and effort during that moment in the meeting and should've left the meeting to do the work.

- ` 2023/06/06 `
  During the evening where we worked late on the limit switches you were the one assigned to the merge request and were making and resolving comments and at one point you just left with no message stating as such and there after I waiting for you for an hour. You blatantly disregarded myself and didn't value my time then. Please when people are waiting on you let them know if and when you are stepping out for the day so they aren't waiting on you.

- ` Many Occasions `
  When we ask you to look at Merge requests then you are often hard to follow up and I have to constantly ask you to re look multipole time to try get the Merge requests through. Please try be vigilant when reviewing merge requests to help get them out quickly to not hold up your team mates. We have a merge request channel for this purpose. 

- ` 2023/07/19 `
  I tried to suggest maybe new more descriptive ways to how you do merge requests you straight up said you will not change ever how you do this process. I was bringing to light a very blunt and non descriptive way you do merge requests. We are supposed to grow and evolve. That's why I was trying to bring this up. I find the way you do comments non informative and very very open. And you automatically assume its just for me that I bring this up. I am trying to do this so anyone you review in the future to have more detail in your intention. You don't specify intention and leave it vague. And not even considering adding more detail goes against growth. You showed no respect for any opinion I had in this conversation and it shows you don't respect my views. I am not sure if it's just me or any one is a lower position than you but it still showed.

When it comes to your interactions with the team you are almost always a ray of sunshine but this I feel to be your weakest point. 

Nigh on every morning you are trying to bring smiles to the team with many jokes and making the team and the product owners laugh. This is a valuable morale boost for team members and i hope you keep this going even into other teams. 

You do conduct yourself professionally and i cannot fault you on that. That being said on the point i said: No or not sure to i want to help you improve on. 

> *Does this individual respect and acknowledge other people’s perspectives and priorities?*

When it comes to others perspectives i feel you are inconsistent. From my perspective and experience: You have showed on a few occasions a lack of regard to my opinions are suggestions made to you or shows a lack of regard to others time. 

To be more specific: 

1. During an evening when a few of us were working late on limit switches to get some of the work out you were assign to an MR and were actively providing feedback on it and then just left without saying you were clocking off leaving myself waiting on you for 30-40 minutes late at night. This shows a lack of thought on your end to others time especially when they are working outside of work hours. Just let people know that you're clocking off if you know they are working with you. Its goes along way and shows that you respect them and their time. 
2. When we ask you to look at Merge requests then you are often hard to follow up and I have to constantly ask you to re look multiple time to try get the Merge requests through. Please try be vigilant when reviewing merge requests to help get them out quickly to not hold up your team mates. We have a merge request channel for this purpose. 
3. One day when I tried to suggest maybe new more descriptive ways to how you do merge requests you straight up said you will not change ever how you do this process. 
   
   I was bringing to light a very blunt and non descriptive way you do merge requests. We are supposed to grow and evolve. That's why I was trying to bring this up. I find the way you do comments non informative and very very open. I am trying to do this so anyone you review in the future to have more detail in your intention. You don't specify intention and leave it vague. And not even considering adding more detail goes against growth. It took Dane speaking with you to even consider what i had said.
   
   You showed no respect for any opinion I had in this conversation and it shows you don't respect my views. I am not sure if it's just how you deal with me or any one is a lower position than you but it still showed. 
   
   Please if a team member is maybe suggesting a way todo something then consider it. An outright no shows no compassion or respect especially when its a way to possible help others. 
   

Another note is thank you for coming forward with issues of my end. You used to not come forward with issues with my behaviour and coming out and talking to me first to allow me to correct my behavior is good. 

These points are from my experience working and interacting with you. You do handle the team well and communicate with them as a whole effectively but there are a few moments when you don't show the same regard that you give others to other members of the team.

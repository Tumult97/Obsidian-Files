### Occurrences

- ` 2023/06/06 ` 
  During a large in person meeting to started to work on other stuff and lost context. This showed you didn't respect the team's time and effort during that moment in the meeting and should've left the meeting to do the work.

- ` 2023/06/06 `
  During the evening where we worked late on the limit switches you were the one assigned to the merge request and were making and resolving comments and at one point you just left with no message stating as such and there after I waiting for you for an hour. You blatantly disregarded myself and didn't value my time then. Please when people are waiting on you let them know if and when you are stepping out for the day so they aren't waiting on you.

- ` Many Occasions `
  When we ask you to look at Merge requests then you are often hard to follow up and I have to constantly ask you to re look multipole time to try get the Merge requests through. Please try be vigilant when reviewing merge requests to help get them out quickly to not hold up your team mates. We have a merge request channel for this purpose. 

- ` 2023/07/19 `
  I tried to suggest maybe new more descriptive ways to how you do merge requests you straight up said you will not change ever how you do this process. I was bringing to light a very blunt and non descriptive way you do merge requests. We are supposed to grow and evolve. That's why I was trying to bring this up. I find the way you do comments non informative and very very open. And you automatically assume its just for me that I bring this up. I am trying to do this so anyone you review in the future to have more detail in your intention. You don't specify intention and leave it vague. And not even considering adding more detail goes against growth. You showed no respect for any opinion I had in this conversation and it shows you don't respect my views. I am not sure if it's just me or any one is a lower position than you but it still showed.

2. Does this individual consistently deliver work that is of a high quality and ensures that this has been quality assured?
3. Does this individual have professional maturity?
4. Does this individual willingly take on work required in their environment that is not aligned with their personal preferences?

Janay, when it comes to your craft you are quite competent as always. You do great work and do well on difficult features like the covenants queue refactor. I have a few comments below as to the reasons why I answered a few of the questions the way I did:

- Does this individual seek feedback on the work they are completing?
> The only reason I say here that I am not sure is because I cant remember seeing it.

## Responsibility to others

1. Does this individual conduct themselves professionally?
2. Does this individual conduct themselves professionally in meetings?
3. Does this individual prepare for meetings?
4. *Does this individual respect and acknowledge other people’s perspectives and priorities?*

When it comes to your interactions with the team you are almost always a ray of sunshine but this I feel to be your weakest point. 

Nigh on every morning you are trying to bring smiles to the team with many jokes and making the team and the product owners laugh. This is a valuable morale boost for team members and i hope you keep this going even into other teams. 

You do conduct yourself professionally and i cannot fault you on that. That being said on the point i said: No or not sure to i want to help you improve on. 

> *Does this individual respect and acknowledge other people’s perspectives and priorities?*

When it comes to others' perspectives, I feel you are inconsistent. From my perspective and experience, you have shown on a few occasions a lack of regard for my opinions or suggestions made to you, or it shows a lack of regard for others' time.

To be more specific:

1. During an evening when a few of us were working late on limit switches to get some work out the door, you were assigned to an MR and were actively providing feedback on it, and then just left without saying you were clocking off, leaving me waiting for you for 30-40 minutes late at night. This shows a lack of thought on your end for others' time, especially when they are working outside of work hours. Just let people know you're clocking off if they are working with you. It goes a long way and shows that you respect them and their time. 
2. When we ask you to look at Merge Requests, you are often hard to follow up with, and I have to constantly ask you to re-look multiple times to try to get the Merge requests through. Please try to be vigilant when reviewing merge requests to help get them out quickly and not hold up your teammates. We have a merge request channel for this purpose.
3. One day when I tried to suggest maybe new, more descriptive ways to how you do merge requests, you straight up said you will not change ever how you do this process. I was bringing to light a very blunt and non-descriptive way you do merge requests. 
   
   We are supposed to grow and evolve. That's why I was trying to bring this up. I find the way you make comments non-informative and very open. I am trying to do this so anyone you review in the future can have more details about your intention. You don't specify the intention and leave it vague. And not even considering adding more detail goes against growth. It took Dane speaking with you even to consider what I had said.
   
   You showed little respect for any opinion I had in this conversation, and it shows you don't respect my views. I am not sure if it's just how you deal with me or anyone in a lower position than you, but it still showed.
   
   Please, if a team member is suggesting a way to do something, then consider it. An outright no shows no compassion or respect, especially when it's a way to possibly help others.

Another note is, thank you for coming forward with issues on my end. You used to not come forward with issues regarding my behavior, and coming out and talking to me first to allow me to correct my behavior is good.

These points are from my experience working and interacting with you. You do handle the team well and communicate with them as a whole effectively, but there are a few moments when you don't show the same regard that you give others to other team members.

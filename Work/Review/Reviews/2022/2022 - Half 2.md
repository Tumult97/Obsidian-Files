## Defenses

### Competence in craft

> 2. Does this individual willingly take on work required in their environment that is not aligned with their personal preferences?  You have always been willing to take on some tickets that you did not necessarily prefer, thank you! I just have one comment to add: You regularly complain to the team that you are given all the most complicated tickets. I believe that all the tickets in our environment have their own unique complexities.

Here I didn't intend to make it seem like I was complaining. I may have been joking but I have felt recently that I have been excited on taking on larger tickets. I know I may have light heartedly joked on how I had an affinity for tickets that just happened to become more complicated than originally thought but ill make more mindful thoughts before talking in this manner. 

### Responsibility to others

#### Janay

> 2. Does this individual have a reputation for a positive attitude?  When you are in a meeting with our product owners, you shine with positivity! You have become the new Kora of standup! However, outside of standup you are usually very negative about your work. You negativity has improved from what it was in the past, but you are known to complain about most things. You are mostly positive towards people, and I understand that the work we do is not always enjoyable. But by complaining about how all the code always breaks when you are coding, could make other members in the team negative.

I admit I do verbally complain about my work when I am having issues but I found that, that is a way I cope and handle and solve through a problem I am having but if it affects the team il find another coping mechanism and adjust my flow from there.

  > It is my expectation that you will build on that foundation by growing the skill to be more resilient. Your lack of resiliency is impacting how you do your job. Be resilient to criticism (MRs has been a common theme as we both know). Be resilient to the frustrations of software development (there was a pattern in our weekly catch-ups where you often sounded discouraged by the technical problem you were facing). And be resilient when you make mistakes. It's not enough to tell yourself to do better in these situations, you need to be prepared and take positive actions. Example, stepping away from your desk to reframe your mind, writing out your thoughts and emotions then reflecting on them, finding books or youtube videos to provide you with tactics. Try build a strategy for yourself that is mechanical and repeatable.

  >  I think you should seek out more opportunities to get involved with the credit managers, for example, doing a demo in one of the DCP training sessions. Maybe speak to Lauren to see if she has anything for you. I know, as devs, we work more on the technical side, but since we don't have somebody like a UX, we need to know the behaviour of our customers. It will greatly improve the quality and usability of our deliverables.

  >  I would still suggest going to the team for assistance, even for non-bug related topics. One example was the feature toggle implementation for ERAC. Having feature toggles is great, but when implemented incorrectly, they can cause a lot of headache later. JP and I are currently working on the submission sheet components. Your feature toggle made it very difficult to determine which of 6 different components would be rendered on the front-end, where ERAC should only have been used on one component. We are refactoring it now, so don't worry about going back to it. For complex pieces of work, I would suggest taking the problem, as well as your suggested solution for the problem, to the new ADT team. The seniors in our team have a lot more experience than us. Something that sounds like a good idea to us, might have hidden flaws that they can uncover upfront, saving us a lot of time in future.

  > It is my expectation that you will build on that foundation by growing the skill to be more resilient. Your lack of resiliency is impacting how you do your job. Be resilient to criticism (MRs has been a common theme as we both know). Be resilient to the frustrations of software development (there was a pattern in our weekly catch-ups where you often sounded discouraged by the technical problem you were facing). And be resilient when you make mistakes. It's not enough to tell yourself to do better in these situations, you need to be prepared and take positive actions. Example, stepping away from your desk to reframe your mind, writing out your thoughts and emotions then reflecting on them, finding books or youtube videos to provide you with tactics. Try build a strategy for yourself that is mechanical and repeatable.

  >  I think you should seek out more opportunities to get involved with the credit managers, for example, doing a demo in one of the DCP training sessions. Maybe speak to Lauren to see if she has anything for you. I know, as devs, we work more on the technical side, but since we don't have somebody like a UX, we need to know the behaviour of our customers. It will greatly improve the quality and usability of our deliverables.

  >  I would suggest sharing more interesting topics during our Popcorn30 sessions. This would improve both presentation skills and assist the team with daily, redundant tasks.
  >  
  >  I would still suggest going to the team for assistance, even for non-bug related topics. One example was the feature toggle implementation for ERAC. Having feature toggles is great, but when implemented incorrectly, they can cause a lot of headache later. JP and I are currently working on the submission sheet components. Your feature toggle made it very difficult to determine which of 6 different components would be rendered on the front-end, where ERAC should only have been used on one component. We are refactoring it now, so don't worry about going back to it. For complex pieces of work, I would suggest taking the problem, as well as your suggested solution for the problem, to the new ADT team. The seniors in our team have a lot more experience than us. Something that sounds like a good idea to us, might have hidden flaws that they can uncover upfront, saving us a lot of time in future.

- JP
  > - Separating Emotion  
	At SB offices when finding an issue with BAC & LS workflow and advising on changes needed to rectify them, you got visibly upset due to all the work you put in that needed to be updated  
	The same happened during a recent ERAC workflow MR. 95% of the feedback was code styling preference. However, due to the volume of it, you became despondent  
	This makes it difficult for the team to critique/advise you due to fear of you getting into a mood  
	By separating emotion from your code, we can avoid this and have the happy-go-lucky, confident Tristan getting shit done 
>	
>	You are working on this by planning out solutions. However, you need to tweak it to deliver smaller chunks of good quality to ultimately complete the task  
	- Smaller, more manageable chunks should alleviate big rework and/or a lot of feedback  
	- Redirect your passion from the code to experimenting, learning, and growing  
	- This way regardless of where in the journey of your career, you can always win  
	- If shit breaks, you learn & experiment on how to solve it. If shit works, you grow knowledge and experience

  > Tristan, I have seen you grow and work on yourself in the short time I have been part of this team. The time which comes to mind is from when you working on an item for the limit switch papers, I think the strategy or logic the buttons had previously used was wrong and you had, had a day of working on it which you needed to relooks at; you had found this while checking your progress on the work and chatted to JP. You were upset and defensive that you had 'lost' a day of work, but looking at the way you have tackled ERAC is a big change to that. 
  > 
  > You have gone through the code/logic thoroughly and asked the questions before jumping straight into coding the solution (thinking of the committee sitting strategy), where you have tried to understand all the logic of the code and requirements instead of trying to 'just get the work done' quickly. When items need to be reworked, from MR comments etc., you don't get defensive, you hear the others out much more calmly and reapproach the work after having a discussion with them. I see the growth and the effort you are putting in to yourself and your coding, and that is great to see. 
  > 
  > *One of the areas I think you can look to grow in, is that of work quality and accepting when something you have worked on isn't working as it should, examples such as the 'ready for bulk approval' logic or the E&S attestation comment being removed for Limit Switch papers. I do see you working on those areas by slowing down your Prod Readiness ticket testing presenting, and discussing with others (like having local testing sessions - such as JP and Janay on the ERAC committee sitting items), it's just the area I do see room for growth.*

  > However, you need to focus on execution and precision. During this review period, there were a few instances where you missed certain failures and functionalities. Although this can happen to anyone, I would like to emphasize the importance of following all the processes and steps to avoid such incidents in the future. For instance, there was a case where you missed some steps in the Done process of Bulk Approval Container Limit Switches, which led to the team missing the testing of this feature, resulting in the wrong implementation and rework. We have discussed this matter before, so I would advise you to put more effort into this area.
  > 
  > Additionally, I want to highlight a few incidents where a production bug was detected, and upon investigation, it was found to be caused by your code. It is understandable that we are a busy development group, but it is crucial to try and recall what we have touched or changed in the code as it can help in the fixing process and understanding the changes made.

  > SUMMARY: ACTIVE LISTENING WITH YOUR WHOLE BODY.  
	We've covered a lot of ground here in the past - from you typing in meetings while Neil is speaking to having your camera off in crucial team chats. So I would like to re-iterate again that how people perceive your listening is important, not the fact that you are listening alone. I expect you to keep your camera on and when customers are speaking, particularly key individuals and creating the right perception in body language through eye contact and active listening. If you are facing challenges given ADHD or other, try find strategies that work for you, a slinky, a toy, whatever. I know you have adopted some already as I can see the attentiveness in stand-ups, backlog grooming and collab days.

- Janay
  > However, there are times when we need to put in some extra time to get important items over the line. For example, one afternoon a bug was picked up, due to a code change that you made. You decided to log off at exactly 15:00, knowing there was an issue, and JP was forced to stay late and fix it for you. We need to be held accountable for the work we do, and sometimes that means putting in some extra time where things are critical in the team and get stuff over the line. It's part of the core principles of 'Responsibility to others'. I'm not saying that you need to stay until 6 every night. Please don't. Keep to your schedule, but be flexible in times of crisis to help your team.
  > 
  > Your sessions come across as unprepared and we catch a number of small issues that you could have picked up through normal testing on your local environment. Perhaps get some tips from JP or Liam on how they determine the different test cases they set up. Make a list of items you want to test, and ensure that you have tested them yourself before the session. We need to be considerate of everyone's time and this will speed up the testing sessions, allowing more time for development.
  > 
  > Another point related to the above, is the due diligence we each need to do when making updates to open MRs. You are prone to merge MRs with linting or failed unit test issues. I think it could be due to your lack of testing after making updates to the MR, while resolving comments. When we point this out, please stop blaming the IDE or linter for missing these things. These are human errors. Take responsibility for them and work on correcting the behaviour in future. Once again, honesty is the best policy.

	-Nothing wrong with having a work-life balance. However, when the Equity Risk workflow broke and I showed you the refactor you made contributed to the issue, I expect you to stay, support and contribute to a resolution  
	-This would've shown you care for the team and willingness to the project to get shit sorted  
	I think this also contributes to you rushing in changes to meet deadlines and relinquishing due diligence responsibilities  
	i.e., Breaking Jenkins builds due to broken tests, compilation errors or linting issues  
	Being more pragmatic and/or adding more effort to get things working the 1st time can alleviate this  
	Measure twice, cut once, kind of mentality  
	i.e., Preemptively providing context to reviewers on your MR. Providing extra proof of due diligence tasks, after MR feedback updates

  >  I have noticed is you are working on another screen/other work while some meetings are going on. I know sometimes we have to, and we all do it from time-to-time, but this is something you can look at trying to minimize, as it is easy to miss something in a meeting if you are working on something else at the same time.

  > Firstly, strive to be consistently prepared and proactive in your work. Anticipate potential challenges or roadblocks and take preemptive measures to address them. Being proactive demonstrates initiative and a commitment to delivering high-quality work efficiently.
  > 
  > Secondly, ensure that you actively pay attention, engage, and maintain a presence during meetings or team discussions. Avoid multitasking or getting distracted by mobile devices, as it can hinder effective communication and collaboration. Give your full attention to the conversation and actively participate by listening and contributing when appropriate.
  > 
  > Thirdly, focus on listening to understand rather than listening to respond. Actively listen to your team members' perspectives and ideas, valuing their contributions. This approach fosters better collaboration, empathy, and mutual respect within the team.
  > 
  > Fourthly, be mindful of your language and attitude, striving to maintain a positive outlook even in challenging times. By promoting positivity, you contribute to a healthier and more productive team environment. During difficult times, maintain a positive outlook and inspire optimism within the team. Encourage and support your colleagues, fostering a sense of resilience and determination. Your positive attitude can help create a more motivated and cohesive team.
  > 
  > I would like to bring your attention to two cases where you could have done better. Firstly, there was an issue with the Business sponsor, and I believe you made a change that caused it to break again. Although JP picked up the issue in production, you could have supported him by discussing it and offering assistance. As team members, we need to support each other, and every line of code we write is our signature, so we need to be proud of it and own up to it.
  > 
  > Secondly, you could improve your attendance at team culture events. I understand that you are busy planning your wedding, but these events are essential for team culture. Please assist us in booking a date and time that works for you so that you can attend and spend time fully with the team.

  > I re-call how you said this is all unnatural for you, but you making it look second-nature. It is my expectation that you will apply yourself to ensuring you have a healthy relationship with Janay. We had many discussions here. You don't have to be BFF's, but you do have to hold one another accountable when code is not right, or processes need to be improved. Remember you are a professional, part of high-performing team and an Entelectual (relationships set us apart). In our next 1:1 I would like to hear how you have taken steps towards a healthier working relationship with Janay.

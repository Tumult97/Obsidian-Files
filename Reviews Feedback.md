  > It is my expectation that you will build on that foundation by growing the skill to be more resilient. Your lack of resiliency is impacting how you do your job. Be resilient to criticism (MRs has been a common theme as we both know). Be resilient to the frustrations of software development (there was a pattern in our weekly catch-ups where you often sounded discouraged by the technical problem you were facing). And be resilient when you make mistakes. It's not enough to tell yourself to do better in these situations, you need to be prepared and take positive actions. Example, stepping away from your desk to reframe your mind, writing out your thoughts and emotions then reflecting on them, finding books or youtube videos to provide you with tactics. Try build a strategy for yourself that is mechanical and repeatable.

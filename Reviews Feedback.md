  > It is my expectation that you will build on that foundation by growing the skill to be more resilient. Your lack of resiliency is impacting how you do your job. Be resilient to criticism (MRs has been a common theme as we both know). Be resilient to the frustrations of software development (there was a pattern in our weekly catch-ups where you often sounded discouraged by the technical problem you were facing). And be resilient when you make mistakes. It's not enough to tell yourself to do better in these situations, you need to be prepared and take positive actions. Example, stepping away from your desk to reframe your mind, writing out your thoughts and emotions then reflecting on them, finding books or youtube videos to provide you with tactics. Try build a strategy for yourself that is mechanical and repeatable.

  >  I think you should seek out more opportunities to get involved with the credit managers, for example, doing a demo in one of the DCP training sessions. Maybe speak to Lauren to see if she has anything for you. I know, as devs, we work more on the technical side, but since we don't have somebody like a UX, we need to know the behaviour of our customers. It will greatly improve the quality and usability of our deliverables.

  >  I would suggest sharing more interesting topics during our Popcorn30 sessions. This would improve both presentation skills and assist the team with daily, redundant tasks.

  >  I would still suggest going to the team for assistance, even for non-bug related topics. One example was the feature toggle implementation for ERAC. Having feature toggles is great, but when implemented incorrectly, they can cause a lot of headache later. JP and I are currently working on the submission sheet components. Your feature toggle made it very difficult to determine which of 6 different components would be rendered on the front-end, where ERAC should only have been used on one component. We are refactoring it now, so don't worry about going back to it. For complex pieces of work, I would suggest taking the problem, as well as your suggested solution for the problem, to the new ADT team. The seniors in our team have a lot more experience than us. Something that sounds like a good idea to us, might have hidden flaws that they can uncover upfront, saving us a lot of time in future.

- JP
  > - Separating Emotion  
	At SB offices when finding an issue with BAC & LS workflow and advising on changes needed to rectify them, you got visibly upset due to all the work you put in that needed to be updated  
	The same happened during a recent ERAC workflow MR. 95% of the feedback was code styling preference. However, due to the volume of it, you became despondent  
	This makes it difficult for the team to critique/advise you due to fear of you getting into a mood  
	By separating emotion from your code, we can avoid this and have the happy-go-lucky, confident Tristan getting shit done

>	You are working on this by planning out solutions. However, you need to tweak it to deliver smaller chunks of good quality to ultimately complete the task  
	- Smaller, more manageable chunks should alleviate big rework and/or a lot of feedback  
	- Redirect your passion from the code to experimenting, learning, and growing  
	- This way regardless of where in the journey of your career, you can always win  
	- If shit breaks, you learn & experiment on how to solve it. If shit works, you grow knowledge and experience

  > Tristan, I have seen you grow and work on yourself in the short time I have been part of this team. The time which comes to mind is from when you working on an item for the limit switch papers, I think the strategy or logic the buttons had previously used was wrong and you had, had a day of working on it which you needed to relooks at; you had found this while checking your progress on the work and chatted to JP. You were upset and defensive that you had 'lost' a day of work, but looking at the way you have tackled ERAC is a big change to that. 
  > 
  > You have gone through the code/logic thoroughly and asked the questions before jumping straight into coding the solution (thinking of the committee sitting strategy), where you have tried to understand all the logic of the code and requirements instead of trying to 'just get the work done' quickly. When items need to be reworked, from MR comments etc., you don't get defensive, you hear the others out much more calmly and reapproach the work after having a discussion with them. I see the growth and the effort you are putting in to yourself and your coding, and that is great to see. 
  > 
  > *One of the areas I think you can look to grow in, is that of work quality and accepting when something you have worked on isn't working as it should, examples such as the 'ready for bulk approval' logic or the E&S attestation comment being removed for Limit Switch papers. I do see you working on those areas by slowing down your Prod Readiness ticket testing presenting, and discussing with others (like having local testing sessions - such as JP and Janay on the ERAC committee sitting items), it's just the area I do see room for growth.*

  > However, you need to focus on execution and precision. During this review period, there were a few instances where you missed certain failures and functionalities. Although this can happen to anyone, I would like to emphasize the importance of following all the processes and steps to avoid such incidents in the future. For instance, there was a case where you missed some steps in the Done process of Bulk Approval Container Limit Switches, which led to the team missing the testing of this feature, resulting in the wrong implementation and rework. We have discussed this matter before, so I would advise you to put more effort into this area.
  > 
  > Additionally, I want to highlight a few incidents where a production bug was detected, and upon investigation, it was found to be caused by your code. It is understandable that we are a busy development group, but it is crucial to try and recall what we have touched or changed in the code as it can help in the fixing process and understanding the changes made.

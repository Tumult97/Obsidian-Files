My selection of "not meeting expectations' is much more reflective of the historic part of this review period than the last month. In the last month, I've been blown away by your positive attitude, your energy, and your consistency. I do know some of the personal challenges you face, and the past few months and last year were not the most conducive by way of working environment for mentoring, grooming, and psychological safety (high stress). I believe these are definite factors that contributed.  
  
We have covered much of this in one-on-ones, but I need the Tristan of the last month to continually show up. You are dealing with criticism much better, understanding that it's not a reflection of you but a process of growth to improve what we deliver. The second thing is that with your more optimistic outlook on the team, rubber ducking, and pairing, the quality of your code and delivery is improving. We're notching up the gears.  
  
A third, and perhaps most important, suggestion is to own your space with extreme ownership. That means taking responsibility for the situation you are in, finding the levers to move out of it, and looking within yourself for strategies on how to effectively deliver despite obstacles. I need you to be a leader on our team, for I am certain of your capabilities. In processing my feedback, this quote felt applicable: "Leadership isnâ€™t one person leading a team. It is a group of leaders working together, up and down the chain of command, to lead. If you are on your own, I donâ€™t care how good you are; you wonâ€™t be able to handle it."

Tristan, I want to recognize your outstanding work as a developer on our team, particularly your impressive contributions to the ENSr system. Your ability to create smart and innovative solutions is highly valued, and we appreciate your efforts. However, there are areas where you can improve, such as becoming more involved and passionate about the projects you work on, which can help you unlock even greater potential.  
  
You sometimes come across as negative during task and problem discussions, affecting team morale and hindering communication. I encourage you to be more aware of your tone and approach, striving for a positive and constructive demeanor when working with colleagues. Additionally, try breaking tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps to manage your workload better and avoid feeling overwhelmed. This approach will help you maintain focus and perform at your best.  
  
Lastly, I'd like you to become more involved in team meetings, problem discussions, and grooming sessions. Active participation in these events will improve your understanding of the projects and contribute valuable insights and ideas to benefit the team. By addressing these areas, I believe you'll continue to excel as a developer and become an even more valuable asset to our team.  
  
So keep up the great work

Tristan, you struggled with bigger pieces of work in the past. Recently, you have been given the Limit Switches work, and you have been doing fantastic there! Well done on stepping outside your comfort zone, owning the front-end work and delivering results! The limit switches paper is a big feature and we are looking forward to see you working on all aspects of the deliverable. Continue working closely with Wiehan so that you are up to date with all the changes he makes in the API. And don't be afraid to ask for help from the team. Asking for help does not make you less competent, on the contrary, you will learn so much faster when discussing problems with more experienced members in the team. You have definitely been reaching out more for assistance and business domain clarification the past 2 weeks.  
  
I have answered "Unsure" for most of the questions above, since an effort to improve your growth was only made recently. I want you to continue growing and working with people in the team, we all want to see you succeed. Keep taking in the advice from your team members, take on bigger pieces of work and work on dealing with criticism, and pretty soon... you will be getting an "Over and Above Expectations" from me ðŸ˜Š.  
  
Having professional maturity is extremely important in our area of work. Your attitude towards your work needs to change. For example: one small mistake made, like forgetting to implement the Upcoming measurement date improvements in all the necessary places, and I could see that it really got to you. You blamed the team for "not giving you a knowledge share on this stuff" or "not being explicit enough" or "not even knowing that a specific piece of logic existed". You need to take accountability for your own mistakes and in this case, it was not asking for help. You can always reach out to Josh or anyone else with the necessary context, play around with the front-end and test different use-cases. That is what team work is all about. You have been on the team for quite some time, you should know that our domain is massive and that it is easily possible for something to be missed. Take responsibility and fix it. After this incident, you just disappeared, leaving the rest of the team to work late that evening reverting the code. You only joined much later and gave a quicker solution to disable the functionality. You did not respect your team's time. Try taking a few deep breaths after receiving criticism. Perhaps ask if you could take a break for a few minutes, but always come back to help your team.  
I know that an effort is being made to mentor you on these aspects, but this growth needs to come from your side as well.

I'm going to be honest with you Tristan, as I believe this will aid your growth. As a developer, I think you write good code. I think you write code well enough to deliver on a task. I believe when you have all the information you need, you can build a feature that meets demand. Now, where I think you can improve is your approach to your work, the accountability (not shame, nor blame) to your work, and the quality of your work. Quite often in the past 6 months, I've seen you give up and point fingers when something isn't complete.  
  
When you work on a ticket, it doesn't seem you go the extra mile to understand the full purpose of the task. Right now, it just seems like you're trying to just get the work done and not necessarily trying to solve the bigger solution. Often when in a testing session, once we get to test your work, it seems to either not be done properly or not working at all. There are two reasons this happens, 1. is a lack of context of the task, and 2. The lack of concern about the purpose of the feature. Often, I've heard you mention that the ticket doesn't specify or that you didn't know about this piece or that piece or you've never seen this before. As an engineer, those kinds of answers indicate neglect. If you wish to understand something, you should go the greater length of understanding where it fits into the bigger picture. Either come to me and ask questions, or lean on documents on confluence, there are quite a few. Remember that when we size a ticket, we size it according to the knowledge we have at that time. But in order to deliver on the ticket, we need to understand the picture to ensure we develop things correctly. We call this system analysis. Part of the Software Development Life Cycle is ensuring we understand the impact of a feature on a system. This is what I think you don't practice yet.  
  
I think you've got real talent man. You're really smart. If you change your approach to developing a solution, I think your craft will grow immensely. This will help ensure a high quality of work and aid you in meeting deadlines. Please know that no one on this team is against you, but rather for you. We're here to help each other. We do not expect you to know everything. We do not expect to not make mistakes. However, we expect you to put in a little more effort in solutioning the problem before beginning development. Own up to your work, and do your best to know the ins and outs of where it fits in.

Doing well:  
* Technical skills  
- You've shown you are more than capable of knocking out features  
- This is evident in the frontend data validation, and integrated E&S notifiers - spanning multiple projects, to name a few  
# This proves you are capable of tackling assigned tasks, well  
# It enables you to become more confident in tackling, either; more work in a similar amount of time and/or more complex tasks  
  
Needs work:  
* Analysing  
- You sometimes rush into getting the work done without doing some technical analysis and planning  
- With the date validation, you could've searched for the measurement date to find where all the validations may be applied  
# This may have enabled you to ask whether the ratchets input required this validation too  
# Taking time to understand the problem, allows you to ask questions to others, and yourself - why is this needed/being done? Are these only required here? Etc.  
# It may also prevent you from getting upset with those trying to help you  
  
* Experimenting  
- You've told me at times, "I don't how it works, I just do this and it's sorted"  
- One example is unsubscribing straight away even though the observable is in a SubSink  
# Not taking the time to experiment and break the code means you're missing out on learning  
# By taking time to learn & really understand, you make better, more robust decisions  
# You also get to coach others or provide feedback during reviews  
# You can also learn from others by implementing the 45-min rule and showing them what you've learned and what else you need to know  
# Also, ask more questions; in sprint sizing or planning, in pairing up, etc.

I believe that you are performing above the requirements of your role for several reasons. Firstly, I believe that you are self-managed. You are able to work independently, and when you ask for help, it is mostly on assistance with domain knowledge, not technical troubleshooting.  
  
Secondly, I think that you have a good feel for our overall CI/CD pipeline, i.e., having awareness of how GitLab, Jenkins and Octo work together, and having awareness of dependencies across the DCP ecosystem in terms of what has been deployed, where, and when. This, to me, illustrates that you are not bound strictly to low level tasks, but rather, you have a broader context of how your work affects the bigger picture.  
  
Lastly, I believe that you have strong technical skill, because I think all of your code that I've reviewed has been at a good standard. My advice would be to try to not stress about technical feedback on your code. A lot of the time, it is just a coding style preference being suggested to you. Those sorts of things are like the icing sugar on the cake; it's not worth stressing about them.  
  
One last thing I would suggest is to spend some time doing cloud related certifications. I'm confident that doing so will expand your problem solving abilities further and position you to be well rounded.

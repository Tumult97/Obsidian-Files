# Competence in Craft

## Dane
My selection of "not meeting expectations' is much more reflective of the historic part of this review period than the last month. In the last month, I've been blown away by your positive attitude, your energy, and your consistency. I do know some of the personal challenges you face, and the past few months and last year were not the most conducive by way of working environment for mentoring, grooming, and psychological safety (high stress). I believe these are definite factors that contributed.  
  
We have covered much of this in one-on-ones, but I need the Tristan of the last month to continually show up. You are dealing with criticism much better, understanding that it's not a reflection of you but a process of growth to improve what we deliver. The second thing is that with your more optimistic outlook on the team, rubber ducking, and pairing, the quality of your code and delivery is improving. We're notching up the gears.  
  
A third, and perhaps most important, suggestion is to own your space with extreme ownership. That means taking responsibility for the situation you are in, finding the levers to move out of it, and looking within yourself for strategies on how to effectively deliver despite obstacles. I need you to be a leader on our team, for I am certain of your capabilities. In processing my feedback, this quote felt applicable: "Leadership isnâ€™t one person leading a team. It is a group of leaders working together, up and down the chain of command, to lead. If you are on your own, I donâ€™t care how good you are; you wonâ€™t be able to handle it."


## Gideon
Tristan, I want to recognize your outstanding work as a developer on our team, particularly your impressive contributions to the ENSr system. Your ability to create smart and innovative solutions is highly valued, and we appreciate your efforts. However, there are areas where you can improve, such as becoming more involved and passionate about the projects you work on, which can help you unlock even greater potential.  
  
You sometimes come across as negative during task and problem discussions, affecting team morale and hindering communication. I encourage you to be more aware of your tone and approach, striving for a positive and constructive demeanor when working with colleagues. Additionally, try breaking tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps to manage your workload better and avoid feeling overwhelmed. This approach will help you maintain focus and perform at your best.  
  
Lastly, I'd like you to become more involved in team meetings, problem discussions, and grooming sessions. Active participation in these events will improve your understanding of the projects and contribute valuable insights and ideas to benefit the team. By addressing these areas, I believe you'll continue to excel as a developer and become an even more valuable asset to our team.  
  
So keep up the great work

## Janay
Tristan, you struggled with bigger pieces of work in the past. Recently, you have been given the Limit Switches work, and you have been doing fantastic there! Well done on stepping outside your comfort zone, owning the front-end work and delivering results! The limit switches paper is a big feature and we are looking forward to see you working on all aspects of the deliverable. Continue working closely with Wiehan so that you are up to date with all the changes he makes in the API. And don't be afraid to ask for help from the team. Asking for help does not make you less competent, on the contrary, you will learn so much faster when discussing problems with more experienced members in the team. You have definitely been reaching out more for assistance and business domain clarification the past 2 weeks.  
  
I have answered "Unsure" for most of the questions above, since an effort to improve your growth was only made recently. I want you to continue growing and working with people in the team, we all want to see you succeed. Keep taking in the advice from your team members, take on bigger pieces of work and work on dealing with criticism, and pretty soon... you will be getting an "Over and Above Expectations" from me ðŸ˜Š.  
  
Having professional maturity is extremely important in our area of work. Your attitude towards your work needs to change. For example: one small mistake made, like forgetting to implement the Upcoming measurement date improvements in all the necessary places, and I could see that it really got to you. You blamed the team for "not giving you a knowledge share on this stuff" or "not being explicit enough" or "not even knowing that a specific piece of logic existed". You need to take accountability for your own mistakes and in this case, it was not asking for help. You can always reach out to Josh or anyone else with the necessary context, play around with the front-end and test different use-cases. That is what team work is all about. You have been on the team for quite some time, you should know that our domain is massive and that it is easily possible for something to be missed. Take responsibility and fix it. After this incident, you just disappeared, leaving the rest of the team to work late that evening reverting the code. You only joined much later and gave a quicker solution to disable the functionality. You did not respect your team's time. Try taking a few deep breaths after receiving criticism. Perhaps ask if you could take a break for a few minutes, but always come back to help your team.  
I know that an effort is being made to mentor you on these aspects, but this growth needs to come from your side as well.


## Joshua
I'm going to be honest with you Tristan, as I believe this will aid your growth. As a developer, I think you write good code. I think you write code well enough to deliver on a task. I believe when you have all the information you need, you can build a feature that meets demand. Now, where I think you can improve is your approach to your work, the accountability (not shame, nor blame) to your work, and the quality of your work. Quite often in the past 6 months, I've seen you give up and point fingers when something isn't complete.  
  
When you work on a ticket, it doesn't seem you go the extra mile to understand the full purpose of the task. Right now, it just seems like you're trying to just get the work done and not necessarily trying to solve the bigger solution. Often when in a testing session, once we get to test your work, it seems to either not be done properly or not working at all. There are two reasons this happens, 1. is a lack of context of the task, and 2. The lack of concern about the purpose of the feature. Often, I've heard you mention that the ticket doesn't specify or that you didn't know about this piece or that piece or you've never seen this before. As an engineer, those kinds of answers indicate neglect. If you wish to understand something, you should go the greater length of understanding where it fits into the bigger picture. Either come to me and ask questions, or lean on documents on confluence, there are quite a few. Remember that when we size a ticket, we size it according to the knowledge we have at that time. But in order to deliver on the ticket, we need to understand the picture to ensure we develop things correctly. We call this system analysis. Part of the Software Development Life Cycle is ensuring we understand the impact of a feature on a system. This is what I think you don't practice yet.  
  
I think you've got real talent man. You're really smart. If you change your approach to developing a solution, I think your craft will grow immensely. This will help ensure a high quality of work and aid you in meeting deadlines. Please know that no one on this team is against you, but rather for you. We're here to help each other. We do not expect you to know everything. We do not expect to not make mistakes. However, we expect you to put in a little more effort in solutioning the problem before beginning development. Own up to your work, and do your best to know the ins and outs of where it fits in.

Doing well:  
* Technical skills  
- You've shown you are more than capable of knocking out features  
- This is evident in the frontend data validation, and integrated E&S notifiers - spanning multiple projects, to name a few  
- This proves you are capable of tackling assigned tasks, well  
- It enables you to become more confident in tackling, either; more work in a similar amount of time and/or more complex tasks  
  
Needs work:  
* Analysing  
- You sometimes rush into getting the work done without doing some technical analysis and planning  
- With the date validation, you could've searched for the measurement date to find where all the validations may be applied  
- This may have enabled you to ask whether the ratchets input required this validation too  
- Taking time to understand the problem, allows you to ask questions to others, and yourself - why is this needed/being done? Are these only required here? Etc.  
- It may also prevent you from getting upset with those trying to help you  
  
* Experimenting  
- You've told me at times, "I don't how it works, I just do this and it's sorted"  
- One example is unsubscribing straight away even though the observable is in a SubSink  
- Not taking the time to experiment and break the code means you're missing out on learning  
- By taking time to learn & really understand, you make better, more robust decisions  
# You also get to coach others or provide feedback during reviews  
# You can also learn from others by implementing the 45-min rule and showing them what you've learned and what else you need to know  
# Also, ask more questions; in sprint sizing or planning, in pairing up, etc.
```


## Liam
I believe that you are performing above the requirements of your role for several reasons. Firstly, I believe that you are self-managed. You are able to work independently, and when you ask for help, it is mostly on assistance with domain knowledge, not technical troubleshooting.  
  
Secondly, I think that you have a good feel for our overall CI/CD pipeline, i.e., having awareness of how GitLab, Jenkins and Octo work together, and having awareness of dependencies across the DCP ecosystem in terms of what has been deployed, where, and when. This, to me, illustrates that you are not bound strictly to low level tasks, but rather, you have a broader context of how your work affects the bigger picture.  
  
Lastly, I believe that you have strong technical skill, because I think all of your code that I've reviewed has been at a good standard. My advice would be to try to not stress about technical feedback on your code. A lot of the time, it is just a coding style preference being suggested to you. Those sorts of things are like the icing sugar on the cake; it's not worth stressing about them.  
  
One last thing I would suggest is to spend some time doing cloud related certifications. I'm confident that doing so will expand your problem solving abilities further and position you to be well rounded.

Need Work:  
Professional Maturity: While you demonstrate a strong focus on learning and gaining competence in your craft, it's important to also develop professional maturity. This includes taking ownership of your work, being punctual, and maintaining a professional demeanour in your interactions with colleagues and superiors. Strive to exhibit professionalism in all aspects of your work consistently.  
  
Accepting Accountability: It's essential to accept accountability for your actions and deliverables. Take responsibility for your work and the outcomes it produces. Avoid passing the blame onto others, even in challenging situations. By accepting accountability, you demonstrate integrity and a commitment to personal growth.  
Seeing Perspectives and Removing Emotion: Developing the ability to see things from other people's perspectives and removing emotion from decision-making and situations is crucial for effective collaboration. It allows for better understanding, empathy, and reaching mutually beneficial solutions. Practice actively listening and considering alternative viewpoints to foster a more inclusive and productive work environment.  
  
Asking for Help and Raising Concerns: While it's commendable that you attempt to solve tasks on your own before seeking assistance, it's also important to know when to ask for help and raise concerns. Don't hesitate to reach out to your more senior peers when you encounter challenges that exceed your current abilities. Effective communication and timely escalation of issues contribute to efficient problem-solving and prevent potential roadblocks.  
  
  
Doing Well:  
Upskilling Efforts: Your commitment to upskilling and developing both soft and technical skills is commendable. Continue investing time and effort into expanding your knowledge and expertise. Seek opportunities for practice and training to enhance your abilities further. Your willingness to learn will contribute to your professional growth.  
  
Following Mentor's Instructions: It's great that you actively follow instructions from your mentors on which areas to focus on for your development. Their guidance can help you identify specific areas for improvement and provide you with valuable insights. Continue leveraging their expertise and mentorship to accelerate your learning.  
  
Applying the 45-Minute Rule: Demonstrating the ability to troubleshoot and debug your work is essential. Applying the 45-minute rule, where you make a dedicated effort to resolve issues independently before seeking assistance, shows initiative and problem-solving skills. Keep utilizing this approach to build your troubleshooting capabilities.  
  
Understanding of Tech Stack: It's positive to note that you understand your tech stack well. Continue deepening your knowledge and staying updated with the latest advancements in your field. This will enable you to contribute effectively to projects and expand your versatility.

This proactive approach to expanding your skill set is highly valuable. Keep seeking project-level opportunities to step out of your comfort zone and acquire new knowledge, both technically and through soft skills.

# Responsibility to others

![[Pasted image 20230528093705.png]]

## Dane
Firstly thank you for caring about the team. I really appreciate the effort you took to build a Code Charter app and publish. You persisted and it made an impression on the team. Not only did you put up our code charter, but you also thought of innovative ways to make the website/app valuable on going in terms of documentation. And the best part is you got something out in learning Flutter.  
  
Thanks for being an active member in the team, in leading discussions, in stirring debate and more so for encouraging the team through tech nuggets or productivity hacks (like ShareX, Sql Crud Generator).  
  
Also well done in leading the charge on my behalf when it comes to the weekly summaries. It's good to see you run with it and build a process around it (even with a bot). Epic!


## Gideon
Tristan, I want to acknowledge your excellent communication skills with team members, as you consistently provide feedback on your work. In addition, your ability to conduct informative demos is commendable, and I appreciate your efforts.  
  
However, there are few things where you can improve. One aspect to focus on is seeking assistance when needed, rather than working in isolation. Reach out to colleagues for help earlier in the development process rather than waiting until the end of a feature. Additionally, I encourage you to share your experiences and help other developers with problems you have faced before, as it will benefit the entire team.  
  
Lastly, don't hesitate to showcase your work through more demos, and remember to keep up with administrative tasks. This includes maintaining the board, testing outline, and documentation up-to-date. By addressing these areas, you'll continue to grow as a developer and become an even more valuable team member. Keep up the great work!


## Janay
Tristan, you are easily making excuses for why you don't attend meetings. For some of our important testing sessions, you were not there. We messaged you to join the meeting and when you eventually joined you used the excuse that "nobody told me that we are having this meeting". When we have important discussions as a team on discord, you are not there. You are also not really participating in important conversations. Yes, you are very sociable when we are not discussing ticket details, but if you are going to be working on a feature, such as Limit Switches, I would suggest asking the questions that you are unsure of when we have the backlog grooming. Start getting involved in team events and meetings. Start driving testing sessions when your or somebody else's work is being tested.  
  
It is also difficult to reach you during working hours at times.  
You need to commit to your work hours. You are paid to work 8 hours a day and Entelect requires you to be available within core working hours: 09:00 AM - 15:00 PM. You regularly need to do something for your fiancÃ©, or update your passport at home affairs, picking up your wedding ring, going to your personal bank, DURING work hours. This last office day, you just got up and left at 13:00 and then you didn't come back online to continue working with us. You did the same thing during some other office days as well.  
You are not giving yourself a very good reputation, and I believe the whole team has recognized this. This alone could get you a warning from Entelect, so you NEED to work on being available, attending office days with your team (except if there is really an emergency) and staying online for your team to reach you. This has been mentioned in your previous review as well, but we have seen very little improvement.  
If you leave your computer or your house during core working hours, keep your phone on you to respond to messages. This will be very important once you start working on customer queries. You will be required to have a sense of urgency and not let business wait for critical responses. We want you to step outside of that comfort zone of isolated development and start interacting with business. This obviously just needs a change in professionalism. Just please keep this in mind.  
  
You have a very negative attitude towards your work and people. At this last office day, you arrived there, greeting us in a disappointing sort of tone. Alex, a team lead from a different Standard Bank team, greeted you and asked how you were doing. But all you said to him was "I hate coming to the office". You did not even greet him back. This is extremely unprofessional and it reflects negatively towards the team. Try to at least show some level of respect when chatting to people at the Standard Bank office. You are only required to come to the office for ONE day each month. And you actually blamed our team lead for "forcing" you to go to the office. Nobody is forcing you. Yes I am also lazy to get up and drive to the office sometimes, but we all still do it, without complaining, to support the team and set a good example in front of our customers. I apologize for coming across harshly, but this needs to be said.  
  
Another important part of remote work is respecting the people in your Teams and Discord calls. Please mute your microphone when somebody else is presenting and there is background noise on your end. Sometimes on discord, you're not at your PC, but we can hear you speak to people in your house. We have asked you on several occasions to mute your microphone and you should try to make it a habit. And it has happened once or twice during standup with our business stakeholders or our testing sessions where we could hear you watching a YouTube video in the background. I understand that you suffer from ADHD, but try not working on other things during important meetings with our stakeholders or business demos. This obviously does not set a professional view of our team towards the customer. Remember, as part of a team, it's one for all and all for one. We take the blame for each other. Perhaps try concentrating on the meeting by taking notes of what everyone is saying. That's helped me a lot when I struggle to concentrate in meetings.  
  
One thing that I have noticed, is the lack of context you provide when you want to ask something. I joined Discord one morning and you just asked a question about a facilities table for staging something out of nowhere. No context. Take into consideration that not everyone knows what your mind is working on at any given moment. If somebody is asking you to repeat your question more that 2 times, know that they lack context, and then perhaps share your screen or draw them a diagram. It's always easier to understand something if you can see it in front of you.


## Joshua
I'm not preview to everything that happens on a daily, but from what I've seen, I think you've got a lot of growing to do here. When it comes to responsibility to others, it seems you're not all there. I've often seen you not being able to accept criticism for the work you're doing. When someone mentions that your work isn't meeting the demand or that your work has forgotten to take something into consideration, you tend to quickly point fingers or sometimes get defensive and mention that you don't have the full context. Now remember, all tickets sized have been groomed and sized accordingly with the team. This, therefore, means that all necessary context was provided upon sizing those tickets. Now, it's absolutely normal to forget, we're human. However, don't use this as an excuse to not go and find out more. As I mentioned above, reach out and look for documentation. Do your best to fully understand the task before rushing to development.  
  
Criticism towards your work seems to really hit you negatively. Your attitude seems to drop when someone says what you've developed is wrong. You shouldn't take this as a shot at your craft credibility, but rather see this as an opportunity to learn more about the business context of what you've developed and how it may impact another feature. See this as an opportunity to improve your system analysis skills.  
  
Remember in order for people to rely on you, you need to show that you're willing to take criticism and you're willing to improve immediately. We all get it wrong sometimes, and that's okay. Take the hit and get back up and show that you understand the urgency and the importance of your work.

Doing well:  
* Swiss knife  
- You take on a multitude of tasks that often leads to touching many projects, such as the E&S notifiers feature and Covenant measurement date  
# This shows you are able to handle any of the domains and able to context switch  
# It also shows that you are comfortable with all aspects of the codebase; frontend, backend and DB  
# It again proves your capability of maintaining/enhancing any of our projects  
  
* Team Application  
- You have recently launched the team application which has our team charter and will continue to be enhance well done bud  
# This will remind us of our agreed-upon values  
# We can also use it to hold each other accountable  
# It also allowed you to develop your programming skills
```


## Liam
I think that you do a good job of communicating your progress on your work items, including when things have gone wrong. However, my advice to you would be to try to remain calm in situations where you feel like things have gone wrong in some way. I understand and can relate to the natural response to such situations.  
  
I don't believe that such situations are as personal as you believe them to be. For example, if you make a mistake which you feel has cost the team in some way, your natural reaction might be to assume that the rest of the team feels negatively towards you and is upset. That is not the case, though. It's not your job to not make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes. We are all adults and we have all been around the block; things go wrong in software (often), and it's our job as a team to work together to resolve the issues that come up. The best thing we can do as a team is to all remain level headed in such situations, and simply do our best to avoid such mistakes in the future. I think you will otherwise end up wasting a lot of energy being too hard on yourself.


## Wiehan
Need Work:  
Approach to Delivering Thoughts: While it's important to contribute valuable insights during meetings, consider refining your approach in delivering your thoughts to other team members. Strive for clarity and conciseness in your communication to ensure that your ideas are effectively conveyed and understood by others. Consider using appropriate examples or visual aids to enhance your message, if applicable.  
  
Timeliness and Estimation Follow-up: Pay close attention to timeliness and follow-up on estimation commitments. It's crucial to manage expectations by delivering work within agreed-upon timelines or proactively communicating any delays. Take the initiative to provide regular updates on the progress of your tasks to your senior peers to maintain transparency and accountability.  
  
Avoiding Blame Shifting: When faced with significant problems, it's essential to avoid shifting blame onto others. Instead, focus on problem-solving and collaborative resolution. Take responsibility for your part in any issues and work with the team to identify solutions and prevent similar problems in the future.  
  
Readiness and Proactivity: Strive to be consistently prepared and proactive in your work. Anticipate potential challenges or roadblocks and take preemptive measures to address them. Being proactive demonstrates initiative and a commitment to delivering high-quality work efficiently.  
  
Active Engagement and Presence: Ensure that you actively pay attention, engage, and maintain a presence during meetings or team discussions. Avoid multitasking or getting distracted by mobile devices, as it can hinder effective communication and collaboration. Give your full attention to the conversation and actively participate by listening and contributing when appropriate.  
  
Listening to Understand: Focus on listening to understand rather than listening to respond. Actively listen to your team members' perspectives and ideas, valuing their contributions. This approach fosters better collaboration, empathy, and mutual respect within the team.  
Spreading Positivity: It's important to avoid perpetuating negative sentiments within the team. Be mindful of your language and attitude, striving to maintain a positive outlook even in challenging times. By promoting positivity, you contribute to a healthier and more productive team environment.  
  
Maintaining a Positive Outlook: During difficult times, maintain a positive outlook and inspire optimism within the team. Encourage and support your colleagues, fostering a sense of resilience and determination. Your positive attitude can help create a more motivated and cohesive team.  
  
Doing Well:  
Team Building and Helping Hand: Your willingness to contribute to the team, regardless of your specific responsibilities, during times of crisis or when you can add value, is highly appreciated. Continue being a team player and offering assistance and support to your colleagues when needed.  
  
Not Overpowering Others: It's commendable that you do not overpower people with your own ideas. Balancing your contributions and respecting the input of others is crucial for maintaining a collaborative and inclusive team environment. Keep encouraging diverse perspectives and constructive dialogue.  
  
Supporting Struggling Team Members: Your efforts to support team members who are struggling or in times of need are praiseworthy. Continue offering your assistance, guidance, and empathy to help them overcome challenges and achieve their goals. This collaborative approach strengthens the team's bonds and fosters growth for everyone involved.  
  
Communication about Availability: It's great that you make it clear to others if you won't be available, informing them of your whereabouts and when you'll be accessible again. This level of transparency ensures smooth communication and helps manage expectations within the team.  
  
Alignment with Processes and Methodologies: Your alignment with the customer's chosen processes, methodologies, and delivery approach is commendable. Continue adhering to these standards to maintain consistency and meet customer expectations effectively.


# Impact on Customer Success

![[Pasted image 20230528094219.png]]

## Gideon
Tristan, I'd like to encourage you to become more involved in client sessions, such as grooming sessions, to help you better understand their needs and expectations. Your active participation can lead to more effective solutions and improved collaboration.  
  
Also, don't be afraid to raise your voice or express customer concerns when necessary. Open communication is crucial for successful outcomes, and sharing your perspective can be invaluable in addressing potential issues.  
  
Lastly, invest a few extra minutes in learning the client's domain. Gaining a deeper understanding of their industry will enhance your ability to provide tailored solutions and demonstrate your commitment to meeting their specific needs.


## Janay
Tristan, it is probably about a year that you've been with us, but you do still struggle with the business domain.  
This is a bit of a problem, since you are one of the older members of our team. The new members would need to reach out for business domain context (especially with Josh leaving), and it would be good for another member to help out.  
But that's okay. I also struggle with the business domain, especially BSnR. It is really important to understand all the aspects that are affected by a change. Our system is massive. Feel free to ask about the business domain whenever, even if it is just testing somebody else's changes. Yes we can't always be extremely explicit on tickets, but usually the tickets are added based on what business asks for. It is our responsibility as the developers to understand where that information needs to change and what other things need to change. Maybe you could try making a flow diagram of how you understand the business workflow and then we can correct or add to your diagram. Then you can add it to our documentation, which will help the entire team.  
  
I've said that you don't know all the stakeholders by name, since you haven't really dealt with any credit managers or executives other than Bev, Neil and Jan. You will start to know other stakeholders once you start getting involved in bigger pieces of work. But as I have mentioned multiple times now, you don't have to do it alone.  
  
We saw at a team lunch that you complained about problems with your relationship with your father to Jan. The conversation got quite intense and you became worked up a bit. I could see that Jan was getting uncomfortable. Yes, it's good to keep a conversation going, but Jan is our Stakeholder. We should try not mixing work with family matters. Perhaps in future, keep to light topics, or ask about our stakeholders and have them open up a conversation you can be part of.


## Joshua
I think you're still grasping the business domain and you're still trying to piece together what the customer is trying to achieve. I'd really like to see you put an effort here. Take the time to ask the right questions after you've done your investigation and research. Take the time to visit those confluence pages. Take the time to understand how the feature you're developing impacts the system. I see you rush to development and write really good code, but in order to best impact the client you need to understand the business domain. You need to understand the bigger picture.  
  
I think you've got really great potential. In order to realize this potential, take a step back and understand that you don't know everything and that you don't always have the answer. Listen to understand, and not to answer. I believe if you really work on this skill, aligned with other things I've mentioned above, you will be unstoppable and the customer will notice it more. Right now, this is really your weak point.

Doing well:  
* Getting shit done  
- There's not been a task that you could not handle. It proves your capability once again  
- You may take on more responsibility because of this. I want you to remember to slow down, analyse, learn and experiment  
# Just because there's added pressure of more work and/or more difficult tasks does not mean you stop the things that can help you  
# Learn how you work best and use that formula to assist you as you take on the added responsibilities  
  
Needs work:  
* Attitude  
- You may not know it but your words can come across as if you're putting the fault on others  
- For example: "Gideon just dumped this on my lap, again". "I asked Janay but she's not responding to me". "That wasn't added to the ticket"  
- I want you to shift your thinking. Why is Gideon handing over work, again? Who else may I ask, as Janay is busy? Should I know about this missing item, could anyone else know, did I analyse sufficiently?  
- Yes, it's difficult in the moment but I want you to think about what you can do with the situation, at that moment, and try to find solutions  
# The situation may be kak but by you trying to gain control you show your resilience and maturity  
# You get creative and find other means to accomplish your goal  
# You learn to adapt and you learn you can overcome, based on past experiences  
# Don't be afraid to bring issues & possible ways to alleviate these issues at retros or stand-ups or even privately with Dane

## Liam
I think that you've done a good job of having insight into when to ask for help from others when it comes to clarifying business logic. This shows maturity and that you are focused on delivering value to the customer. I have seen with your work that you also want to take full responsibility for your individual work items, and that you are willing to go the extra mile to get your work over the line. The team and the customer really appreciate your commitment.  
  
I think that you did an awesome job with the team charter; it's looking really good. Please keep up the good work and keep looking for areas of improvement, both in our code and in our processes.

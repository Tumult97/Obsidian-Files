I know this is not the review you want, but I am certain, from what I've seen this past month, that if you stick to that trajectory, next periods review is going to be an entirely different result. Stand strong.

Lekker!  
Thanks for all the hard work and dedication bud! You've touched a lot of different projects which have contributed to a broader knowledge of the client's domain. Unfortunately, this was sometimes handed over to you, so that other team members can shift their focus to new priorities. You voiced your concerns to me about work being dumped on your lap, and how frustrating that is. I'd like you to voice that to the team - should it happen again. We should adapt and be agile but that does not mean we compromise our quality due to new urgent requirements along with committed work. Instead, we inform others that this new work means others will be deprioritised and only attended to in the next sprint iteration. These situations are tough because they require context switching. However, they are also opportunities to get to know the domain a little more  
  
You have also voiced your displeasure at the lack of details, and fully-fledged requirements to satisfy a task's completion. The recent date validation on multiple projects is a good example. You did well in not only having a working solution, but you did so pretty quickly. Unfortunately, it was later made aware that another part of CT required this functionality as well. You were right in the ticket not stating this. Unfortunately, this meant your hard work would not be deployed, which made you quite upset. I want you to learn from this though. We won't know everything about a ticket. It's part of the process to ask questions (to ourselves and others) as we analyse and plan our solution(s).  
  
I'd like you to experiment more. Play around with different projects. Try to understand why they're used and what real word problem they're solving. I feel once you gain this understanding, you are able to make more informed decisions. This can benefit you in knowing when a task is fully complete - you know the new task's dependencies and potential pitfalls. You ask better questions to gain understanding to solution better, or ultimately advise on the value/lack of value this task is trying to solve. Instead of jumping into a task, I want you to slow down and think about it. Why are you doing it? What does it solve? What are its dependencies? I can most definitely assist you with this. We have those sessions where we demo our understanding of a specific requirement in a project. I want to see you perform a few of these so that you increase your domain knowledge. Once you have a better understanding of the domain you are able to catch missing requirements in tickets, or possible side effects a feature may have.  
  
I think you get in your own way, in terms of trying to prove yourself so quickly but not taking the time to learn. When we pair up, I feel rushed. It's my fault for not slowing you down and learning together. I apologise and I will strive to do better at this. The best way for you to grow is to learn. You can push out 20 decent tasks in quick time but it means very little if you don't know why you did those tasks, or how it affects the overall goal, or maybe the architecture. You're at a stage where you have the freedom to learn, experiment, and fail. You learn a lot more from failures, it can be a good thing. If you feel you don't have the time and/or freedom, let Dane know. There are also techniques like time-boxing, pair programming and general analysis to allow for this.  
This will allow you to stop saying "I don't know how to do this in Angular", or "I had trouble with not unsubscribing before", and start to figure it out. By using the 45-min rule you do your investigation, then pair up with someone to share your knowledge and gain more knowledge from others. Be inquisitive, and ask questions. If people are busy, set time up in their diaries to book their time while you continue to experiment and learn. If you learn, you may be able to share, and if you share, you may even learn more. Join 1 of the Entelect forums as a presenter one day and you'll see what I mean.  
  
You've done quite well in all the projects you've touched. Quite a few features spanned across multiple projects. That can be quite complex. So you should be proud of the work you've done.  
You're also building the team a fines app along with a few other goodies, that I'm excited about. Not only for something to play with but that you are doing side projects. It's an awesome way to learn & grow.  
Thank you for your hard work and the banter. You add to our hard-working but fun environment to get shit done and enjoy doing so. Keep up the good work bud

As an individual, there are areas where you can further improve your professional maturity, and accountability, and avoid blame-shifting. Developing the ability to see perspectives and removing emotion from decision-making will contribute to more effective collaboration. Remember to ask for help and raise concerns when needed. Refining your approach to delivering thoughts during meetings will enhance clarity and conciseness. Additionally, prioritize timeliness, follow up on commitments, and take responsibility for your work. Being prepared, proactive, engaged, and avoiding distractions will maximize your productivity. Spreading positivity and maintaining a positive outlook contribute to a healthy team environment. Ensure preparedness and active participation in meetings to maximize their value.

Your understanding of the tech stack and continuous upskilling are valuable assets. Creating an app for skill enhancement demonstrates your proactive approach to growth. You excel as a team player by supporting colleagues and striking a balance in your contributions.

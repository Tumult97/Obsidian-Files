	3. Wants the best for the project
- Negative
	1. `2022/10/28` Can come across a bit aggressive when trying to debate his side
	2. `2022/10/28` Does at times seem adverse to change
	3. You seem to try change this team to what your old team is/was. At times I feel as if you just want to be there. Advise here is that I agree that sometimes some teams do stuff better than others and advice is good but maybe try adjust team culture rather than fully change the course. ___WiIl monitor this point___
	4. Can seem to want to jump ship but that can be your being careful
	5. I understand that you don't want to be in a project that is struggling but wanting yo jump ship before trying to help it sail is concerning
	6. Lack of communication when it comes to helping with tickets and giving them to someone else. this causes frustration

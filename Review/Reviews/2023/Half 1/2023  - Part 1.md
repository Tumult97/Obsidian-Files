#### Competence in craft

First of All Gideon you are an amazing Developer and you do amazing work and you are competent in your abilities and craft. You do great work and are great to work with. I do have some criticisms in a few areas that i want to make you aware of to make you grow into your future.  

Thinks I liked:
1. You always seemed very enthusiastic and you are always showing praise to your team mates
2. You are a very confident worker and very skilled
3. You do make reliable work and tools to help anyone in the future

Things I didn't like:

1. You are confident but often it comes across as condescending and you at times fail to communicate some information
2. At times you can seem like you don't always pay mind to the mental health of others in your team and can seem mocking towards them
3. There are cases where you didn't show care for urgency  of others in the team
      - When I asked for variables to be added to the build for E&S you said you would add it later and didn't when we needed to deploy to SIT. This was frustrating and made it look as if I didn't complete my work yet it was out of my control
4. There are times where you can be a bit over confident and cocky(There was a time that you clearly didn't test a change because it stopped a service from building)
5. You sometimes just compile work and it starts to add up. You dont communicate this and this has an effetc on the team as work that you didnt finish gets dumped on them
6. You can seem to overcomplicate a solution and rush into teh first idea that comes into your head

I feel as if you can sometimes just think about yourself and get overconfident in your abilities. We are all human and i just want you to consider others opinion, abilities, health and skills when thinking about projects and work and considering the well being of your teams in the future. I hope you take these to heart because i belive you can be an amazing lead in the future


#### Responsibility to others

You work very well in a team Gideon and we can trust you to deliver your work when its needed. You show appreciation and are very positive in general. 

Thing I liked:
1. You show great interest when someone shows you something new
2. You show great care in general regards to the team
3. You care about efficiency and about not wasting time
4. You are quick to reply on some quick things that will aid another team member

Things I didn't like:
1. In meetings with the client you act professionally and calm. In meetings with us about half the time you seem to want to rush through meeting and just get them over with without considering the value it would add to the team and the process of others within
2. You seem adverse to change when provided with another's opinion and seem to completely disregard any other option that you didn't come up with
3. You can seem to not consider others opinion on a matter and gets frustrated when you don't fully understand their intentions behind a solution.
4. There have been many occasions when i requested help and you kept saying you would do it but when it came to release you didn't do it and went on leave leaving me looking like i didn't do anything please make notes on when you can and cant do something
5. please communicate more when you are taking personal time as you can disappear

Mate I hope you can be a little more considerate towards your team mates as they are your backbone as well in a team. Yes you are a senior but also consider teh opinions and request of even the newest of members. 

You do like to help and are great when you do. Guide the new ones you take under your wing and you'll be an amazing lead and an even better developer in a team. 


#### Impact on customer success

When it comes to dealing with the customer you take great care in hearing and listening to their concerns. When they give you a feature you come up with great ideas and want to make great software to show them. 

This can be a little bit of a slow down because you do like to get into the change and do a great job without thinking first but that's besides the point. You take great care in providing the client team sufficient information to help them understand our side of the work being done. You are a great addition to the team when dealing with the clients and they always seems to love working with you. 

You are the dev that all salesman thinks that we are. Amazing and always really willing to work with the clients. 


#### Is there any feedback on this person that you wish to remain confidential?

I want to say that in regards to how Gideon works he can be very very cocky. He has multiple times disregarded work he piled up in his todo which then got dumped on me because they were less important. It is important to say when you cant get to something and give people context when handing over work.

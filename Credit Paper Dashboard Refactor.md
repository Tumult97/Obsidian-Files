## Problem

The current Credit paper Dashboard is built using an Angular Material TabGroup. This is easy to use. However with all the new sections being added the tabs are now overflowing past the bound of the view and have to be scrolled to find. As this continues the problem will become worse. These tabs will become more and more of an annoyance to find.

See above. at first glance one cant easily find the newer tabs as they are off screen. SO the user has to find the tab and scroll around. 

Another note is that some of these tabs seem redundant as they have overlapping data that is loaded for each tab.

> Impact: Low



## Proposal 2 - Stacked tabs

> Difficulty: Low
> Time: Low
> Impact: Medium



## Proposal 3 - Refactor and Coalesce

> Difficulty: High
> Time: High

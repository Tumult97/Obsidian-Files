## Doing well

+ Planning features with mock-ups and flows
+ There are too many times to list just a few where you comes to the team and ask for feedback on how you plan out features
+ There have been many, many times where Bev and Jan have sung your praise
+ You are always available to have time for us developers when discussing features(Please give me some of those extra magic hours you have)
+ You are learning these systems we have extremely quickly and we can always count on you knowing the system or learning what you need to, to help us
+ You always are up to learn and admit what you don't know

## Needs Improvement

- There are times where I feel you can ask your team for context when planning a feature because there are occasions where features planned needed more context before final planning and sizing
- This is a teamwide one: time estimation of tickets, we are getting better but we as a team need improvement
- Sometimes your communication can seem vague on teams: maybe just prefix with some context before jumping into your topic that you need discussing

## Doing Well

+ Social Champion: you are striving to keep this team wellness and morale up and the connection between team members strong like with the team buildings and the shirts
+ I always see you asking for feedback on your work to improve yourself and the work that you do. Keep that up and you will grow very fast
+ You showed you are able to handle a large feature by yourself, with the recent example of the Bulk Approval container you have made huge strides
+ Your meeting prep is nigh on perfect 
+ You are very caring and you try to help keep the team accountable
+ 


## Needs Improvement

- This is a teamwide one: time estimation of tickets, we are getting better but we as a team need improvement
- There are times when I feel planning can be done more before you start a large feature, maybe just a small logic flow diagram can be done before hand with some feedback from a team amber will go a long way
- Sometimes in your communication you can seem very harsh and a bit too direct, it can seem that you are annoyed: try soften your message but still keep to the point
- I don't see you upskilling very often, when you have time it would be great to see you trying new things/ languages and bringing them to your team

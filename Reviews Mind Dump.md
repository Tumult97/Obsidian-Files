## Doing well

+ Planning features with mock-ups and flows
+ There are too many times to list just a few where you comes to the team and ask for feedback on how you plan out features
+ There have been many, many times where Bev and Jan have sung your praise
+ You are always available to have time for us developers when discussing features(Please give me some of those extra magic hours you have)
+ You are learning these systems we have extremely quickly and we can always count on you knowing the system or learning what you need to, to help us
+ You always are up to learn and admit what you don't know

## Needs Improvement

- There are times where I feel you can ask your team for context when planning a feature because there are occasions where features planned needed more context before final planning and sizing
- This is a teamwide one: time estimation of tickets, we are getting better but we as a team need improvement

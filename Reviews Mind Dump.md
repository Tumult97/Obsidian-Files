## Doing Well

+ Social Champion: you are striving to keep this team wellness and morale up and the connection between team members strong like with the team buildings and the shirts
+ I always see you asking for feedback on your work to improve yourself and the work that you do. Keep that up and you will grow very fast
+ You showed you are able to handle a large feature by yourself, with the recent example of the Bulk Approval container you have made huge strides
+ Your meeting prep is nigh on perfect 
+ You are very caring and you try to help keep the team accountable

## Needs Improvement

- This is a teamwide one: time estimation of tickets, we are getting better but we as a team need improvement
- There are times when I feel planning can be done more before you start a large feature, maybe just a small logic flow diagram can be done before hand with some feedback from a team amber will go a long way
- Sometimes in your communication you can seem very harsh and a bit too direct, it can seem that you are annoyed: try soften your message but still keep to the point
- I don't see you upskilling very often, when you have time it would be great to see you trying new things/ languages and bringing them to your team
